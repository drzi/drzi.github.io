## Undergraduate Projects

* * *
### A System to Monitor and Count Vehicles Using Video Feeds from Traffic Cameras
Implement computer vision models optimized by OpenVINO to detect and count vehicles, identify traffic congestion, and adjust traffic signals, or calculate Co2 emissions.

* * *
### Wildlife Monitoring System in Natural Habitats
Implement animal detection and classification models optimized with OpenVINO to process images and videos captured by camera traps, providing insights into wildlife behavior and population.

* * *
### Develop a Real-time Object Detection System Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Use hls4ml to convert a pre-trained CNN model into HLS code, and deploy it on an FPGA to achieve high-speed object detection with low latency.

* * *
### Create a Speech Recognition System for real-time applications.
Convert a recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) model into HLS code using hls4ml, and implement it on an FPGA to process audio signals in real-time.
