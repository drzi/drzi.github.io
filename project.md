### A Comparison Between Different Metaheuristics for Efficient Networks-On-Chip Exploration

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been proved as an efficient way in finding schedulable mapping based on single and multi-objective optimisation for hard real-time embedded NoC. Other metaheuristics are available but yet to be studied in detail of their capability in finding the schedulable mapping for the systems. Although the optimal mapping is hard to find by the metaheuristics due to the arbitrary generation of population, the optimisation time can be a determined factor for selection of the best algorithm. A comparison study will be conducted between the GAs and the other metaheuristics to identify which metaheuristic has the fastest convergence.
