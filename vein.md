### Securing Cryptographic Key Using Finger Vein Based Fuzzy Vault

Biometric finger vein has been widely used for authentication as one of its advantages is resistance to criminal tempering whereby it is located underneath skin. Currently there were many methods proposed to extract the pattern of finger vein. In this paper, we extend one of the current methods by combining it with conventional method used in fingerprint for minutiae extraction to extract the minutiae points of finger vein. The minutiae points will be used for the authentication system that needs only points to be stored in its database. Experimentation has been conducted to monitor each of steps until the minutiae points were extracted. On the other hands, the trial also using different values of distance to evaluate which distance could produce acceptable results to be selected as good minutiae points.
