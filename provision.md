### Comparison Study Between Expectation and Experience of ICT Provision in University

Nowadays  most  of  the  students  in  the  universities  have  been  exposed  to Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  at  school  or  home.  At  certain  extent, they are  good at exploring and evaluating any new technology options presented to them. They  might  expect  more  when  coming  to  university  or  no  less  than  what  they  have experienced previously. What expectations they have  on IT provision in  university? How ICT  influences  their  learning  experiences  at  university?  Does  it  measure  up  to  the expectations? Does the universityâ€™s IT provision is adequate to support new teaching and 
learning  methods in collaborative  learning environment?  These are  some  of the  questions we  hope  to  explore.  Finding  from  this  research  will  help  determine  what  kind  of improvement  through  ICT  that  is  relevant  to  improve  learning  and  teaching  methods  that 
will enhance learning experiences of the students.
